Hi, I'm Arushi Rathore, a passionate self-taught  web developer and a student. I started coding just for fun but ended up liking it a little too much, I'm constantly learning new technologies and frameworks. I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
